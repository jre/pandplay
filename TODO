test update with both controller apps on min and max api versions
read media3 session demo app
handle timeouts, http errors and api errors gracefully
handle sql errors gracefully
ensure I'm using audio offload when available
check if glide is properly caching scaled album images
can I securely store the api password somehow?

do the media session bits have debug logging I can enable?
  sometimes weird unreproducable things happen and logcat is useless
  maybe player.addAnalyticsListener ?

rework sqlite with future DBs in mind
  use an abstract dao to eliminate local room datasource
    create separate daos for each data type

track extra song metadata via a room
  store all metadata needed for future features
  save station info locally after being deleted remotely
    get extended station info so stations can be recreated

polish initial flow:
  rewrite preferences in compose
  walk through setting login info and successfully logging in,
  then load station list and select stations to download,
  then set criteria for downloading stations, offer option to download now

handle api login errors
  add an invisible preference flag indicating login info is valid
  if login info isn't valid, show login preferences
    pre-fill any existing login info
  don't attempt to contact api if login info invalid
    show a message if network request was something interactive
    post notification for automatic network requests
    maybe disable ui controls for synchronous api calls
      do this if network is unavailable too

tweak settings
  change actionbar title
  hide bottom bar
  make signin button look a little more like a button
  option to not display a media notification (and not play in background)
  option to autoplay
  option to disable auto-pause on output disconnect
  option to show password?
  show size quota as a percentage of available space
    alternately specify it as the number of songs, total

scheduled background downloads
  musicdb maintenance
    drop music from db if music file missing
    remove art and music files not referenced in db
    download album art mentioned in db but not found locally
    remove unreferenced album and artist db entries
    
  scan for orphaned art and media files after download
  also for orphaned album and song entries in the db
  or maybe 
  manual download should cancel itself if a periodic download is running
maybe use cache storage for replaceable data like album art?
  this probably doesn't make sense anymore with tagging gone
  need to be able to re-download them regardless
    maybe when downloading new songs, scan for missing art and orphaned music files?
      need to detect missing music files too

better playlist randomization
  chose a window size
    maybe 1/3 or 1/4 of the station's songs
    use a minimum size when selecting songs for the case where only a few songs are downloaded
    also use a maximum size so that newly-downloaded songs show up soon
  when the current song is 2/3 of the way through the window, discard the first 1/3 of the playlist
  when the playlist length is less than the window:
    sort station's songs by last played date (never played sorts before all played songs)
      remove songs that are in the current playlist, if any
    select enough songs from the beginning of the sorted list to increase playlist size to window size
    randomize the selected songs and append to playlist
  need to handle very small song lists too
  remember playlist, current song and position after destroying mediasession

use station checksum to refresh stations automatically whenever downloading songs
  do this implicitly when validating login info, but don't otherwise expose to user
  add a custom reshuffle action/button?
  audit for any place which can't handle stations being added dynamically
    maybe this means removing loadStations()

theme and layout tweaks
  properly style everything
  different layouts for sideways or large screens?
    show playlist and player side by side?
    show sidebar with actions?
  don't allow newlines in exittext prefs
  better ui on player screen
    single play/pause button
    make text look better
    proper margins
    progress bar and time code
    unload/reload button?
  maybe use toolbar instead of system appbar?

use station artwork
  maybe when no queue loaded?
  maybe in action menu, or station switch menu
  maybe have a separate station recyclerview
    controls to opt-in a station for downloading
    number of songs downloaded

better free space management
  action to clear all or some stations
  per-station download size management?

menu item to quit program
  maybe pref to quit on swipe if not playing



non-core features for when above is complete:


implement the new api in case this one disappears
show station creation info, to allow station to be recreated
multiple accounts?
output routing to cast to other devices?

android auto
  https://developer.android.com/training/cars

queued offline api calls
  banning and loving
    custom commands
    https://developer.android.com/media/media3/session/control-playback#available-commands
  tired
  add, edit and removing stations
  genre stations?

rewrite as kmp with compose
  audio:
    interesting reference for KMP audio player: https://github.com/SEAbdulbasit/MusicApp-KMP
      they also use the spotify api
    korge audio is maybe the only KMP library: https://docs.korge.org/audio/
    otherwise use different libraries with expect/actual
  rewrite the UI in compose
  sqlite room is kmp now apparently

underlying search functionality in the media session
  add SessionCommand.COMMAND_CODE_LIBRARY_SEARCH
  implement MediaLibrarySession.Callback.onSearch
  check for MediaItem.requestMetadata.searchQuery in onSetMediaItems

add a separate interface for browsing on-device music
  allow showing one station or all music
  sorting/filtering by artist, album, song, other metadata in db?
  show all song, album, artist metadata when song is poked
  search visible
  allow playing of individual songs
    insert song into current playlist, after current song?
